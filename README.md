# Analysis_of_Fake_Currency_Circulation_in_India & Detection_of_Fake_Currency_using_Statistical_Image_Processing_and_Machine_Learning

Counterfeit currency poses a serious challenge to India’s economic stability and public trust, contributing to financial losses and supporting illegal activities. As fake notes become more sophisticated, traditional detection methods are increasingly inefficient. This project analyzes counterfeit currency trends across Indian states using official government and law-enforcement data to identify high-risk regions. It also proposes a cost-effective, automated fake note detection system using image processing and machine learning. Trained on the Banknote Authentication Dataset, the model uses key statistical features to accurately classify genuine and counterfeit notes, offering a scalable solution for banking, retail, and digital applications.

## Project Objective
    ✓ Analyze the temporal trends of counterfeit currency circulation in India over a defined time period using historical data.
    ✓ Visualize the state-wise distribution of fake currency to identify regional patterns and potential hotspots of circulation.
    ✓ Develop a Python-based automated detection system that uses image processing and statistical analysis to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit currency notes.
    ✓ Extract and evaluate key statistical image features such as kurtosis, skewness, entropy,
    and variance for effective classification of currency notes.
    ✓ Apply machine learning algorithms for training and testing models that accurately classify
    notes as genuine or counterfeit.
    ✓ Provide a user-friendly and portable tool, in the form of a web application, that enables
    individuals and institutions to verify the authenticity of currency notes quickly and
    efficiently.
